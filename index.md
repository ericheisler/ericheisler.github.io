## About me

![](images/aboutpic.JPG)

I'm a maker of many things. This usually involves mathematical software, electronics, machines, robots, microcontrollers, woodworking, baking, 3D printing, gardening, etc. I am currently teaching computer science at the University of Utah while figuring out the next thing to make.
